The Manipulator is about initalization, command and telemetry. Devise a plan to replace it, using a command / telemetry approach based on JMX and CDI for configuration.
See how the resources can be read from the class path using deltaspike @ConfigProperty (see PetStore as well)

The monitoring should be JMX based. That means, no need for infrastructure in osk for that. Try to go JMX 2.0 way (even if this one was not released)

Therefore, CommandHandler would dissappear, and no need in StaxInput for that.

The building of the models and the connections between model instances. It is also CDI. That means removing the connections section and injecting the appropriate bean types in the classes. 

The providerSubscriber section : this should be converted to CDI event handling.

The meshes: 
Maybe can be also event based.
